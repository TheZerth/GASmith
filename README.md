GASmith is a header only Geometric Algebra intended for use by ludites and intermediates.

I noticed while trying to teach myself GA and experiment that all of the available GA libraries are cattered to academic uses.
While very powerful, for someone not extensively familiar with GA and the math-jargon, they are very cumbersome to use.

This project is my attempt at making a simple plug and play library to implement GA maths into whatever project you want to use it in.

The intention is to have a very simple configuration stage to set up the algebra, as well as many pro-configured options for typical use cases.

After configuring the space you will be easily able to perform algebraic operations on the geometric objects.
You will also have access to a wide range of pre-built features such as involutions, rotations, reflections, translations, etc...

The library should be efficient enough for use in real-time simulation and systems modeling.
